# MARUNDONA - schivi e salti i nemici, ma lo fai con Maradona

### **What is MARUNDONA**

Marundona is a **2D endless pixelart game** where the player impersonates **Diego Armando Maradona** in his quest to **dribble opponents while maintaining ball possession**. Matches will take place in one of the stadiums where Diego Armando Maradona displayed his **football wizardry**, obviously all unlockable by the player, and the opponents will be **the greatest personalities in soccer history**, such as **Pelé**, **Ronaldo the Phenomenon**, **Messi**, **Haaland** and many others.

The main works that guided the development of **MARUNDONA** are **Pokemon**, for its power-up and attack system, **Jetpack Joyride**, for its endless game map, and **Super Mario Bros** for its themed environments and game setting.

### **Inputs and Controls**

The player will take control of Maradona **running relentlessly** to get **as far as possible from his own goal**, facing different **adversaries**.

**Maradona's forward movement** is **automatic** and the player will not be able to stop him until he loses possession of the ball (or until he presses the pause button); however, at his disposal to counter opponents, **Maradona will have a series of driblling** at his disposal.

The game will **start** after the user presses the *"Play ”* button, triggering the game-starting animation: from Maradona's goal, **the referee will hand the ball to the player and whistle the start of the match**, whereby commands will be **enabled to the player** and Maradona will start running. The only condition that could **end the game** is the **loss of ball possession** by Maradona, which can occur **when an opponent has not been successfully dribbled**.

The player will have at his disposal some money to bribe the referee into calling the **VAR**, which will decide that **Maradona has lost possession due to a foul intervention**. In that circumstance **play will resume** from the point where it had stopped.

Each **dribbling** has a specific **player profile** that guarantees its **efficacy**; the more the opponent you are facing does not meet this profile, the more likely it is that the dribbling will have no effect. For example, a sombrero cannot be effective on very tall players like Cristiano Ronaldo or Virgil van Dijk, while it is very effective on short players like Lorenzo Insigne or Lionel Messi.

### **Scoring system and balancing**

At the time **the game ends**, a **score will be awarded proportional to Maradona's distance** from his own goal; specifically, from the start of the game a **counter** will keep **track of the course** so as to notify the player of the current score.

The counter may have **modifiers**, influenced by the **level** at which Maradona is during the game. That level goes up **based on the dribbles** that are made against various players.

### **Dribbling system and opponents**.

As already anticipated, Maradona will have at his disposal **enhancements** with which he will be able to **dribble certain opponents**. Each game, the player will have **4 dribbling slots** to allocate, which can be filled in the game by encountering special icons that signal the **presence of a dribble**. If the slots are all filled, the player may decide to **make room** by removing one of the accumulated dribbles, **but losing the ability to use it**. However, **dribbles have limited use**, otherwise **Maradona's opponents would learn the technique** and no longer be surprised: when the number of uses of a dribble runs out, the slot will be **automatically freed** and space will be made for a new enhancement.

In addition to a number of uses and a player profile, dribbles are also characterized by **experience points**: when Maradona uses a dribble he **gains more experience** and increases his level. The number of uses will be inversely proportional to the experience points of a dribble to incite the player to **develop a strategy** on which dribbles to use and which not to use.

When Maradona reaches a **new level**, the player is given the opportunity to **increase the level of one of the available dribbles** as well. The level of a dribble **increases its strength**, allowing Maradona to **overtake opponents with greater ease**; for example, the sombrero at level 1 may have no effect with an average-sized player such as Giovanni Di Lorenzo, however by increasing the level the probability of effectiveness increases.

When an **adversary he has never met before** is presented in front of the player and it **is dribbled**, Maradona will be able to **vant in front of the cameras** that he has dribbled it, making it part of his **collection**. The player will have a special section in the main menu where he can **consult the list of dribbled players** and their **characteristics**, so that he can better manage the dribbles to be used against them.

**Stadiums and history**

As soon as the game is downloaded, the player will take on the role of a **young Maradona**, newly introduced to the world of soccer. As he **kills miles** and **meets opponents**, **Maradona evolves** by changing teams, stadiums, and countries. Stadiums and teams can be **collected** and **played** by the player who reaches a **determined score** or meets **determined players** who have left their mark on the **God of Soccer**'s career.
